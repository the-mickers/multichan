# multichan

Multichan is a plugin for hexchat that will allow you to see all channel messages in a separate tab. From this tab you can also send messages back to specific channels.

To send a message from the multichan tab:

> \#channel message

To ignore a user, channel, or just a user's messages in a specific channel:

> /mc_ignore nick
> /mc_ignore chan
> /mc_ignore chan/nick

To unignore:

> /mc_unignore
